#Web_API_CHALLENGE
An application that will show you the weather of any city when entered. Default city is Austin until the user adds a new city.

When the user enters a city name and clicks "search", a fetch request is sent to the OpenWeather API where information for the temperature of the week for that city is sent back. 

Once the user has submitted a city name, that city will display as a button underneath the search section. User can click between past searches.

The application sends a request and displays the results in a form of a banner and cards. The banner will display the current date and the cards will display the weather for the rest of the week.
